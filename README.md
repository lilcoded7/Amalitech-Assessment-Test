## 📌 Project Overview

**SecureVault-Dashboard** was built for *SecureVault Inc. (Enterprise Cloud Security)* as part of the Amalitech Assessment Test.

The objective was to design and implement a modern, high-performance **File Explorer Dashboard** capable of handling deeply nested folder structures while maintaining performance, usability, and accessibility.

Although this was primarily a frontend challenge, I implemented a microservices-style architecture:

* **Frontend:** Next.js + TypeScript
* **Backend API:** Django (REST API)
* **Deployment:** Vercel

The frontend communicates with the Django backend via secure API endpoints.

### Design System Includes:

* Typography scale
* Color palette (Dark Mode)
* Spacing grid
* Component states (hover, active, focus, selected)

## 🏗️ Phase 2 – Implementation

### 1️⃣ Recursive File Explorer

* Renders folder structure dynamically from JSON/API data
* Fully recursive component architecture
* Supports unlimited nesting depth
* Expand/Collapse without page reload

### 2️⃣ File Details Panel

* Click to select file
* Displays metadata (Name, Type, Size)
* Distinct visual selection state

### 3️⃣ Keyboard Accessibility

* ↑ / ↓ → Navigate visible items
* → Expand folder
* ← Collapse folder
* Enter → Select file

## 🧠 Recursive Strategy

The file explorer is built using a recursive component pattern.

Each folder component:

* Receives its own children
* Calls itself for nested folders
* Maintains local expansion state
* Propagates selection state upward when required

This ensures:

* Clean abstraction
* Infinite depth handling
* Efficient rendering
* Maintainable component structure
